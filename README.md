### Summary

In this project, I explored the concepts of threading and synchronization in programming through a practical implementation of the "Philosophers" problem. The goal was to simulate a scenario where philosophers sit at a table and think, but they need forks to eat. This project helped me understand how to manage multiple threads and avoid issues like deadlock and race conditions.

### Key Features

- **Thread Creation**: I learned how to create and manage threads in C, allowing multiple philosophers to think and eat simultaneously.
- **Mutexes**: I implemented mutexes to ensure that only one philosopher can use a fork at a time, preventing conflicts and ensuring safe access to shared resources.
- **Memory Management**: I ensured that all dynamically allocated memory was properly freed to avoid memory leaks, adhering to good programming practices.
- **Norm Compliance**: The project was developed following strict coding standards (Norm), ensuring clean and maintainable code.

### Conclusion

This project not only improved my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of concurrency and synchronization in software development. It was a valuable experience that I am excited to share on GitHub!
